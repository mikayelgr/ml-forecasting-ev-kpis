# Forecasting EV Growth with Machine Learning

### Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts key performance metrics and growth trends of electric vehicles (EVs) 
using supervised machine learning techniques. Developed as part of DATASCI112 Principles of Data Science
at Stanford University, it applies data-driven models to predict EV adoption patterns and industry trends.
The research outcomes are documented in this repository's PDF file.
